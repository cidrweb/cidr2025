            <h2>CIDR 2025 Registration</h2>

			<A NAME="Venue"></A>
			<h3>Venue</h3>

<p>
CIDR 2025 will be held from Sunday, January 19, 2025, to Wednesday, January 22, 2025, in the
<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/FBcvXWytBt9MZqFy8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
>Mövenpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Piet Heinkade 11, 1019 BR Amsterdam, Netherlands</a>.

<a name="Registration"></a>
<h3>Registration</h3>

<p>
To register for CIDR 2025 and to book your room at the Mövenpick Hotel,
<u><em><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/cc/cidr-2025-3743479" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
>please use this link</a></em></u> .
<br>
<b><em>Registration closes on Thursday, December 19, 2024.</em></b>
<br>
In case you have any questions regarding the registration, please (first)
carefully read the detailed information below and (only then) feel free to contact
Stefan Manegold (CIDR Local Arrangements) via email (<em>first-dot-last-at-cwi-dot-nl</em>).

<p>
<em>
NOTE: you must use the above link to register and to reserve a room, i.e., do not
contact the Mövenpick Hotel directly to book your room.
</em>

<p>
Registration for CIDR 2025 includes in-person on-site attendance to the conference,
3 nights of accommodation in the Mövenpick Hotel, all meals during the conference
(from dinner on Sunday til lunch on Wednesday), as well as all applicable taxes.

<!--
<p>
The first week of registration will be open only for (co-)authors of
accepted CIDR-2025 contributions (papers, abstracts, demos).
-->

<p>
Papers at CIDR are expected to be presented by an experienced author; the
form will ask to indicate which paper(s) are authored plus speaker
information.
<p>
For students, there is reduced registration fee, i.e., € 100.- discount.
Please use Promo Code "<b>student</b>" during registration (i.e., while purchasing your ticket).

<p>
At this time, partial day registration and off-site registration are no
options.  You must register for all three days of the conference.  If you
really need to, you can check-in after Sunday January 19 or check-out before
Wednesday January 22 --- please specify so in your registration form ---,
however, the total registration fee remains the same.

<p>
Participants may also arrive up to 3 nights before the conference or stay up
to 3 nights afterward and will be charged the Mövenpick guest rate we
negotiated for the conference.  That rate includes accommodation, taxes and
breakfast, but no other meals.  These optional extra days can be specified
in the registration form.

<p>
The registration offers the choice of three room types: (1) <b>single room</b> (one
attendee), (2) <b>double room</b> (one attendee and one non-attending
guest/companion), (3) <b>shared room</b> (two attendees sharing a room).  All fees
are per attendee.  Fees for double rooms include accommodation and breakfast,
only, for one companion per attendee/room, i.e., companions cannot
take part in any conference activities or meals (coffee breaks, lunches, dinners).
For shared rooms, please specify your roommate during the registation process.

<p>
The registation allows you to specify dietary restrictions (if any).  We'll
forward this information to the hotel to adjust their meals accordingly as
far as possible.

<p>
You may cancel your registration for a refund (minus Eventbrite's Ticketing Fees)
<em>before Thursday, December 19, 2024</em>. After that date, no refunds will be made.

<p>
Questions, concerns, comments: contact
Stefan Manegold (CIDR Local Arrangements) via email (<em>first-dot-last-at-cwi-dot-nl</em>).

 <h2>Amsterdam Data Science Event</h2>

<p>
Directly after the conference, on Wednesday January 15 15:00-17:30, there will be a special meetup of <a href='https://amsterdamdatascience.nl/'>amsterdamdatascience.nl</a> very near the CIDR venue, with three speakers among whom Michael Stonebraker and Christopher Re from the CIDR community. This event for the community of local data scientists and academics, will be free to attend; also for CIDR attendees. We thought that maybe this is interesting to know for your planning. As mentioned, it is possible to stay extra nights in the hotel.

  <A NAME="VisaInformation"></A>
  <h2>Visa Information</h2>

<p>
Please consult this website: www.netherlandsandyou.nl to see whether you
need a visa to enter The Netherlands, and apply well in advance if you need
one.
<p>
We provide visa invitation letters to data management research/industry
community members, or anyone who will credibly attend CIDR 2025.  Please
contact
CWI secretary Martine Anholt Gunzeln by email (<em>M-DOT-Anholt-DOT-Gunzeln-AT-cwi-DOT-nl</em>)
<!--Stefan Manegold (CIDR Local Arrangements) via email (<em>first-dot-last-at-cwi-dot-nl</em>)-->
to apply for this service.  Please indicate in the email which
accepted CIDR 2025 contribution (paper/abstract/demo) you are an author of
and whether you will present it yourself.
If you are not an author, please explain your connection with CIDR 2025 or
the data management research or industry community, if that is non-obvious.
Please also indicate your professional affiliation as relevant for CIDR.
We may ask you to register and pay for the conference first (in case the
visa is denied, we would refund).
<p>
Some additional remarks:

<ul>
  <li>Most CIDR 2025 attendees would be interested in a short-stay visa, type
 business - this matches the conference invitation letter.</li>
  <li>When the visa application form asks for a contact person, this would be
 Martine Anholt Gunzeln <!--Stefan Manegold--> of CWI.  You can find address and phone number on
 the letterhead of your invitation letter.</li>
  <li><!--Martine tries-->We try to handle invitation letter requests quickly, it should take
 just 2-3 business days.</li>

 <li>The visa application process is organized differently, depending on where
 you live.  This sometimes includes third parties (e.g., in the USA, it is
 handled by an organization called vfsglobal).  Therefore, please carefully
 read and follow the instructions on the NetherlandsAndYou website
 mentioned above, which is the official one from The Netherlands.  Its
 starts by asking you from where you are applying.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Note for applicants resident in the USA: It has been reported that the web
system of vfsglobal shows no appointments available.  Please call
+13473292738 or email them on netherlands.usa@vfshelpline.com if you hit
this issue.
