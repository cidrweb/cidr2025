            <h2>CIDR 2025 Registration</h2>

            <strong>TBD</strong>
            <!--<p> DR 2025 will be held at Mövenpick hotel in Amsterdam. Registration is a two-step process.</p>

            <h3>Conference registration</h3>

            <p>First, register to CIDR and pay the conference fee at <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cidr-2024-tickets-740974283027?aff=oddtdtcreator">EventBrite</a>.</p>

            <h3>Accommodation</h3>

            <p>Second, book your room at <a href="https://be.synxis.com/?Hotel=35424&Chain=21123&arrive=2024-01-14&depart=2024-01-17&adult=1&child=0&group=605030">Chaminade</a>.

            <p><strong>Single rooms</strong> may be reserved using the Chaminade registration webpage.</p>

            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The single room rate is $1242.21 which includes all taxes and fees. The webpage incorrectly lists an additional $281.22 for taxes and fees. Ignore it. You will not be charged that amount.</p>

            <p><strong>Shared rooms</strong> cannot be reserved on the website. Instead, contact the Chaminade booking agent by email <a href="mailto:Krysta.Souza@chaminade.com">Krysta.Souza@chaminade.com</a> or phone (831-465-3458). Please have the name of your roommate available for her.</p>

            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The shared room rate is $884.40 per person. This includes all taxes and fees. <strong>As above</strong>, ignore the $281.22 of additional taxes and fees on the booking page. You will not be charged that amount. 

            <h3>Booking extra days</h3>

            <p>If you wish to book a room at Chaminade before or after CIDR 2024, please contact the Chaminade booking agent by email, <a href="mailto:Krysta.Souza@chaminade.com">Krysta.Souza@chaminade.com</a> or phone (831-465-3458). Email is preferred.</p>

            <h3>Contact</h3>

            <p>If you have questions, please contact the CIDR Local Arrangements chair: info@cidrdb.org.</p> -->

            <!-- <A NAME="Venue"></A>
			<h3>Venue</h3>

<p>
CIDR 2024 will be held from XXX to XXX, in the Mövenpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Piet Heinkade 11,
1019 BR Amsterdam, Netherlands.

<a name="Zoom Registration"></a>
<h3>Zoom Registration (free)</h3>

<p>
As there turned out to be only a handful of paid Zoom registrations, we decided to reimburse these and to downgrade our AV setup, as this can be expensive.
</p>
<p>

<h3>Zoom audience</h3>
<p>You can use the Zoom chat to submit questions during a presentation. The Zoom moderators will
either ask the question on your behalf or (preferably) tell you to ask your question live
according to the process described above.
The choice depends on the preference of the speaker and session chair. Note that remote
questions will be interspersed with questions from the in-person audience.</p>

<h3>Interaction in the Q&A session via Zoom</h3>
<p><strong>Audio setup:</strong> your microphone is muted by default and cannot be unmuted unless requested by an organizer.
	The organizers will unmute speakers and will moderate the discussion in the Q&A session.</p>

<p>To ask a question:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Raise your hand using the <emph>"Raise Hand"</emph> feature and, if possible, turn on your camera.</li>
	<li>When your question is coming up, an organizer will ask you to unmute.</li>
	<li>Accept the invitation to unmute.</li>
	<li>Ask your question and engage in the discussion. Do not mute your microphone yet.</li>
	<li>Once the discussion is finished, mute your microphone.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Registration</h3>

<p>
To register for CIDR 2024 and to book your room at the Mövenpick Hotel,
<em><a href="https://eur.cvent.me/LQ2A5">please use this link</a></em> .
<br>
<b><em>Registration closes on <s/>Monday, December 19, 2022</s> Tuesday, December 27, 2022.</em></b>
<br>
In case you have any questions regarding the registration, please (first)
carefully read the detailed information below and (only then) feel free to contact
Stefan Manegold (CIDR Local Arrangements) via email (<em>first-dot-last-at-cwi-dot-nl</em>).

<p>
<em>
NOTE: you must use the above link to register and to reserve a room, i.e., do not
contact the Mövenpick Hotel directly to book your room.
</em>

<p>
Registration for CIDR 2024 includes in-person on-site attendance to the conference,
3 nights of accommodation in the Mövenpick Hotel, as well as all meals during the
conference (from dinner on Sunday til lunch on Wednesday).
<br>
(Registration for remote attendance via Zoom might open at a later point in time.
 Please be aware, though, that <em>all presenting authors are required to attend CIDR 2024 in-person on-site in
 Amsterdam</em>.)

-->
            <!--
<p>
The first week of registration will be open only for (co-)authors of
accepted CIDR-2024 contributions (papers, abstracts, demos).

<p>
Papers at CIDR are expected to be presented by an experienced author; the
form will ask to indicate which paper(s) are authored plus speaker
information.
<p>
Students have a reduced price, as indicated in the form (i.e., EUR 100.-
lower).

<p>
At this time, partial day registration and off-site registration are not
options.  You must register for all three days of the conference.  If you
really need to, you can check-in after XXX or check-out before XXX
--- please specify so in your registration form ---,
however, the total registration fee remains the same.

<p>
Participants may also arrive up to 3 nights before the conference or stay up
to 3 nights afterward and will be charged the Mövenpick guest rate we
negotiated for the conference.  That rate includes accommodation, taxes and
breakfast, but no other meals.  These optional extra days can be specified
in the registration form.

<p>
The registration offers the choice of three room types: (1) <b>single room</b> (one
attendee), (2) <b>double room</b> (one attendee and one non-attending
guest/companion), (3) <b>shared room</b> (two attendees sharing a room).  All fees
are per attendee.  Fees for double room include accommodation and breakfast,
only, for one guest/companion per room/attendee.  Guest/companions cannot
take part in any conference activities or meals (coffee breaks, lunches, dinners).
For shared rooms, please specify your roommate during the registation process.

<p>
The registation allows you to specify dietary restrictions (if any).  We'll
forward this information to the hotel to adjust their meals accordingly as
far as possible.

<p>
You may cancel your registration for a full refund (minus a EUR 100.- fee)
<em>before Thursday, December 22, 2022</em>. After that date, no refunds will be made.

<p>
Questions, concerns, comments: contact
Stefan Manegold (CIDR Local Arrangements) via email (<em>first-dot-last-at-cwi-dot-nl</em>).

free of charge (only) under the condition that all not locally resident
attendees stay in the conference hotel.
Thank you very much for your understanding and cooperation!

 <h2>Amsterdam Data Science Event</h2>

<p>
Directly after the conference, on Wednesday January 15 15:00-17:30, there will be a special meetup of <a href='https://amsterdamdatascience.nl/'>amsterdamdatascience.nl</a> very near the CIDR venue, with three speakers among whom Michael Stonebraker and Christopher Re from the CIDR community. This event for the community of local data scientists and academics, will be free to attend; also for CIDR attendees. We thought that maybe this is interesting to know for your planning. As mentioned, it is possible to stay extra nights in the hotel.



  <A NAME="VisaInformation"></A>
  <h2>Visa Information</h2>

one.

community members, or anyone who will credibly attend CIDR 2024.  Please
contact
CWI secretary Martine Anholt Gunzeln by email

accepted CIDR 2024 contribution (paper/abstract/demo) you are an author of

Some additional remarks:

<ul>


 <li>The visa application process is organized differently, depending on where

 handled by an organization called vfsglobal).  Therefore, please carefully
 read and follow the instructions on the NetherlandsAndYou website
 mentioned above, which is the official one from The Netherlands.  Its
 starts by asking you from where you are applying.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Note for applicants resident in the USA: It has been reported that the web
system of vfsglobal shows no appointments available.  Please call
+13473292738 or email them on netherlands.usa@vfshelpline.com if you hit
this issue.
